INDIVIDUAL RESEARCH PROPOSAL BRIEF:
Your research proposal should include the   following aspects:
Research purpose
1. Introduction: introduce the research problematisation that underlies your choice of topic and its background or connection to the relevant literature/evidence. What is the research all about? Why is it important or interesting?
2. Overall aim(s) and objective(s) and research question(s)
Literature review
To comprehensively understand the existing research landscape in your area, it is crucial to delve into both theoretical and empirical literature, which will lead to the development of the hypotheses. Therefore, you are expected to review the existing theoretical and empirical literature and develop hypotheses in this section.
The section should include:
1. Theoretical framework
2. Empirical evidence
3. Hypotheses (where appropriate)
Methodology
Which research paradigm do you intend to use and why is it most appropriate?
Research methods
What will your data sources be (databases, questionnaires, interviews, etc)? What method of analysis are you likely to use?
Critique of project
What limitations do you envisage of your research? Research project timetable.
References
Ensure your proposal is fully and properly referenced.<代 写MANG6322 Foundations of Research in Accounting & Finance SEMESTER 2 2023/24Python
